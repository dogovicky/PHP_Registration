# PHP User Management System Documentation

## Overview

This PHP-based project implements a user management system. The system allows users to:

1. Register for an account.
2. Log in to their accounts.
3. Reset their password through email in case they forget it.

The system uses a MySQL database to store user details and PHPMailer for sending emails.

## Features

1. **User Registration:** New users can create accounts by providing personal details.
2. **User Login:** Registered users can log in using their email and password.
3. **Password Reset:** Users can reset their password by receiving an email with a reset link.
